# Solidity contracts powering Retok tokens

This repository contains the contracts used by Retok tokens:

- WhitelistToken is the ERC1404 implementation of a restricted token
- Distributor is a contract used to distribute incomes to holders of WhitelistToken, as an arbitrary ERC20 coin.


This README is a stub. It will be populated soon.
